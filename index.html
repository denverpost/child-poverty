			<p class="caption">Dee Fleming is comforted by her daughter Amy while talking about her son. Diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, Dee&rsquo;s son ingested prescription medications and cleaning supplies then soaked himself with gasoline and lit himself on fire. When his burns no longer required hospitalization the doctors said he was free to go and he did not need in-patient psychiatric treatment. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t think that he would ever have done this had he not been driven by forces in his mind,&rdquo; Dee says.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<section class="row">
	<div class="large-9 large-centered medium-11 medium-centered small-12 columns">
		<p class="lead">Dee Fleming tried to protect her son from the voices in his head, the ones that told him he should die.</p>
		<p>She chased after him the night he ran toward the neighborhood church with a baseball bat in his hand. She worried to the point of exhaustion when he didn&rsquo;t come home at night, then returned beat-up and missing his watch. She thought she was holding it together, if barely.</p>
		<p>One day last April, when he was oddly quiet and confused, almost catatonic, Fleming took him to Swedish Medical Center&rsquo;s emergency room and told doctors he was suicidal.</p>
		<p>They sent him home.</p>
		<p>Two days later, Fleming&rsquo;s son downed dozens of prescription medications and household cleaning supplies, doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire in her front yard. He lived only because a neighbor called 911 to report something smoldering on the lawn. A police officer who knew him kept him conscious until an ambulance arrived.</p>
		<p>What came next for the Fleming family was almost as shocking, a battle for treatment that epitomizes the massive breakdown in care for mental illness in Colorado and the nation.</p>
		<p>Doctors treated his burns&mdash;but not his mind.</p>
		<p>Despite the family&rsquo;s pleas and a months-long battle, their 37-year-old son was released from Porter Adventist Hospital to a transitional shelter.</p>
		<p>The mental health care system is in crisis. More than 50 years after states began shuttering mental institutions, the system hasn&rsquo;t recovered&mdash;leaving emergency rooms, jails and shelters as last-ditch stops to handle the most severe cases.</p>
		<p>Each year in Colorado, about 260,000 adults and children need treatment for the most severe mental illnesses&mdash;schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and serious emotional disturbances. Yet tens of thousands go without care; nationally, only about a third of people who need treatment get it.</p>
		<p>Colorado is paying millions of dollars to treat people with severe mental illness after their disease has escalated to the point of catastrophe instead of investing more in care when it strikes. Of the $887 million spent in Colorado on mental health in 2010 from all sources, half went to treatment of needy patients in clinics and state psychiatric hospitals. The rest was spent in prisons, jails, hospital emergency rooms and psychiatric units, and the child welfare system.</p>
		<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t as simple as limited government resources. Hospitals get more money from insurance companies by fixing physical conditions rather than mental ones, and they refer to their psychiatric units&mdash;if they have them&mdash;as charitable operations.</p>
		<p>The fallout from this shortage in care is severe: suicides, mass shootings, a huge population of prisoners, the homeless on the streets.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only condition for which we wait until stage 4 to try to treat,&rdquo; said Moe Keller, a former state senator and now vice president of public policy for <a href="http://www.mhacolorado.org/" title="Mental Health America of Colorado website">Mental Health America of Colorado</a>. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t do this with cancer. If someone went to their doctor with a tumor, they wouldn&rsquo;t say wait until stage 4. But they do it with mental health.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Families struggle to find help before it&rsquo;s too late, navigating a confusing health system with too few options and battling a Colorado law they say is so weak that they can&rsquo;t make treatment decisions when their loved ones are too sick to realize they need help.</p>
		<p>Attempts to <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_25831191/debate­-rages­-colorado­-over-involuntary­-holds­-mental­-illness" title="Debate rages in Colorado over involuntary holds for mental illness - The Denver Post">strengthen that law have failed</a>, even after violent events in Colorado have raised alarms over failures of the country&rsquo;s mental health system. And even as Colorado&rsquo;s suicide rate has risen to the <a href="https://www.afsp.org/understanding-suicide/facts-and-figures" title="Understanding suicide: Facts and figures - American Foundation for Suicide Prevention">sixth highest in the nation</a>.</p>
		<p>The state ranks near the bottom in per-capita psychiatric treatment beds reported by hospitals, and in the bottom half in per-capita state and federal spending on mental health.</p>

		<h3 class="subheading">Fighting for help</h3>

		<p class="lead">Dee Fleming&rsquo;s son&mdash;burned so severely on his torso, arms and legs that he had to wear a skin suit&mdash;spent 10 months in University Hospital&rsquo;s burn unit. His mother recalls just four psychiatric visits during that time, and when his burns no longer required hospitalization, doctors said he was free to go. He did not need in-patient psychiatric treatment for his schizoaffective disorder, they said.</p>
		<p>Only when the Flemings hired a lawyer and threatened to sue the hospital did University administrators find their son a bed at a psychiatric center called Bridge House. A psychiatrist there recommended a 90-day hold, diagnosing serious mental health issues that put him in danger.</p>
		<p>But the burns were too severe for Bridge House to treat, and within days the center sent him to Porter Adventist Hospital. Porter kept him for just four days, determining he no longer needed in-patient care. The hospital released him to a temporary, assisted-living shelter for people with mental illness.</p>
		<p>It was freezing cold in the middle of winter, and his burns were still healing. &ldquo;They gave him a blanket and said goodbye,&rdquo; Fleming said. &ldquo;This is not humanity.&rdquo;</p>

It helped me think of it a little bit differently. It still is a daily reminder of what happened.

		<p class="insetquote">&ldquo;I should run on the double. I think I&rsquo;m in trouble.&rdquo; <span>&mdash; Lindsey Buckingham, in Courtroom 3H</span></p>

		<p class="lead">George Brady has a thing for weed.</p>
		<p>It relaxes his mind, he says, so he smokes it even though the judge, his caseworker and his therapist keep telling him it&rsquo;s messing with his medication for schizoaffective disorder. He thinks it gives him clarity, but to everyone else, George seems more confused and forgetful when he is high.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Stay away from the marijuana,&rdquo; Judge Barajas is telling him for the 20th time at least. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s a struggle for you, and especially the spice. Are we on the same page?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>George, 28, sees the world through an altered reality, a haze so thick it is improved but not lifted by his monthly medication shot. He hasn&rsquo;t hurt anyone but has been to jail 36 times, usually for what he terms misunderstandings. His most recent arrest was for loitering too long at a truckstop Wendy&rsquo;s. Then he was stripped of his bus pass last summer because an agent caught him trying to sell &mdash; George says give &mdash; a bus voucher to another rider.</p>
		<p>He continued to ride anyway, because how else would he get from the motel in the shadow of Interstate 70 east of Denver to his court-ordered therapy appointments downtown?</p>
		<p>It happens all the time, this total disconnect between two systems. The courts are paying for George to get therapy and stay out of jail, while the city transportation system is taking away the bus pass he uses to get to therapy.</p>
		<p>George did not realize as it was happening that he was losing his bus pass; he figures it out in court several days later. He is wide-eyed, eyebrows raised, head cocked, giving the judge one of his signature dumbfounded looks. &ldquo;RTD is everywhere! That means I can&rsquo;t be nowhere!&rdquo; he says.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>George is tall and softspoken. He wears his pants baggy, still with the store tags, and lets his hair grow until it is sticking up. He says he doesn&rsquo;t know what schizoaffective disorder &mdash; a combination of schizophrenia and mood disorder that alters his perception of reality &mdash; is, really. What he has, he says, is &ldquo;hard times.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like I hear imaginary voices or see imaginary people,&rdquo; he says, sitting on his motel room bed, snacking on sunflower seeds and chuckling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been feeling a lot better. I&rsquo;ve been getting rest. I&rsquo;ve been eating. I&rsquo;ve been exercising, playing basketball. I feel a lot better.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He&rsquo;s taking Trazadone to help him sleep and a monthly shot of Invega &ldquo;to be clearing my thoughts,&rdquo; George said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="caption" style="margin-bottom:3em;">&ldquo;I have low self esteem. I know that for sure,&rdquo; says Darcy McCarthy as she puts on makeup before leaving her hotel room to look for apartments and try to convince landlords to consider her despite a criminal history. Darcy, who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD and severe depression, says the Court to Community program is forcing her to stay sober and get her life together. <span class="capwarning">WARNING: This video contains graphic language.</span></p>
		</div>
		<p>Week after week, she tells the judge she is doing &ldquo;fine,&rdquo; but says there are days she sits in her room alone, listening to sad music and crying.</p>
		<p>Darcy has been seeing a psychiatrist. Within a few weeks on antidepressants, she is noticeably changed: less irritable, more social, more optimistic about finding her own apartment.</p>
		<p>She never wants to return to jail. She says she is done with booze. She says she is done with her ex, also an alcoholic. Until the day she runs into him as he is being released from jail and she is heading into Thursday court.</p>
		<p>She dashes into a bathroom to comb her hair.</p>

		<p class="insetquote">&ldquo;Hello? Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Is there anyone at home?&rdquo; <span>&mdash; Pink Floyd, Courtroom 3H</span></p>

		<p class="lead">No one is cured of mental illness, or the closely connected substance abuse, at Court to Community.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They are not curable diseases, but we are putting them in remission,&rdquo; said Shari Lewinski, program administrator for Denver&rsquo;s behavioral health courts. &ldquo;When we first meet them, they are lost, they are confused, unkempt, angry, bitter.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That is the most horrendous, cruelest aspect of mental illness &mdash; that it is a brain disease. Any other illness, you wouldn&rsquo;t argue with the doctor about what the treatment is. Your behavior is what is impacted by mental health, and people pass judgment on that.&rdquo;</p>
