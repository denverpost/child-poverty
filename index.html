Earlier he ventured into the living room and went unnoticed for a few minutes. But then his mother yelled, &ldquo;I told you to get out of my living room.&rdquo; He bowed his head and returned to his room, where he retreated under the bed and banged on the metal frame. Dorsey, who could hear the noise, said, &ldquo;He’s mad and pouting.&rdquo; She then shouted to her son, &ldquo;I know you mad, but that&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="lead">Denver&rsquo;s Sun Valley, the poorest neighborhood in Colorado, is a welcome shelter for Shawnette Dorsey, 32, and her three children, ages 13 months, 8 and 13. The family, who had bounced from apartment to shelter to friends&rsquo; homes, finally landed an apartment at Decatur Place for single parents willing to enter a two-year program to get back on their feet. She and the kids say grace and go to church on Sunday. Still, life isn’t easy. Both of her sons have been in and out of trouble at school. In September, she lost her job, so now the family lives off unemployment checks, food stamps and Medicaid.</p>

			<p class="lead">Sherry and Eli Martinez, ages 40 and 39, are raising eight of their nine children in an adobe home and an adjacent building on their property. The adobe house was built by Eli's father more than 75 years ago. Sherry earns $21,000 a year at a hospital nine miles away, but Eli, a war veteran, is unable to hold a job. Poverty has been a way of life for generations in this part of the San Luis Valley. But Eli is too proud to accept food stamps. Instead, he spends time with the children, hunts for meat and takes seasonal jobs in nearby potato farms. All the kids pitch in to fix meals, feed the animals and gather firewood for the stoves.</p>
